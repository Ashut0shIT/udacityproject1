            <h2>My blog post</h2>

            <p class="lead">Traveling helps one in many things in life like reducing stress which I mostly do by cycling or going for a nature walk to places like Karura Forest among others. I have come to appreciate and discovered how privileged I am to live in Kenya for this is one if the most beautiful country in this world, from our snow capped mountain, the panoramic views on our hills, the magnificent lakes to a well preserved Cultures that is admired all over the world</p>

            <p>Anyway, those were my thoughts that stormed my mind as I was taking my travel curiosity to the Land where Kenyan well known politicians and even billionaires of this country have their roots in. This time round my destination was the beautiful cool and magnificent Mathioya in Muranga county where I can say its the land of milk and tea. (Yes there is a prominent leader from this area called “Wa Iria” that means “person of milk”) My target was to get to Aberdares cottages that I was not told that I should be so ready for more than just the cottages or my destination. </p>

            <p>Driving from Nairobi along the Super Highway of Thika Road and branching off to the land that lays so green and so much of an Island made me feel like I was in the Wonderful terrace farmlands if Kisoro or Rwanda. It was so green and farmlands graced every patch of this land of Muranga.</p>

            <p>This was on an invite by my great adventure brother and a fellow Wanderlust called #TravelWithEliud and this time we got someone else onboard and she is the Mrs Kajiado county called Sation Parmuat (this lady made me have a clear picture as to why we all need to be traveling all over this country.)</p>

            <p>We kept guessing our directions as we always lost our mind on reading the signage for the exchange of administration of this green land of the Kenyan highlands I now understand why why this and other highlands were a cake to fight for by the early settlers.</p>

            <p>This was one of the places I have been and already got the true idea of it of being the best getaway destination since the location can only be good for you how wants to hide away from the busy life of this world and be deep in the countryside where not everyone can find you and spoil your holiday or private time away from busy life as you enjoy your break.</p>

            <p>On getting to this magnificent and perfect getaway, I was so amazed and felt so much at home yet far from home. The views of the Kenyan countryside makes you forget the busy city and the cool breeze from River Mathioya as it roars at the foothills makes it all one of the best place to be to enjoy peace and natural environment.</p>

            <p>The Aberdares cottages are divided into beautiful Tented rooms that are at Ksh 10,500 for double and also the solo traveller is catered for at Ksh 7,500 on single plan on full board plan. And if you are in for African and countryside feeling, there are cottages made of timber to give you the real countryside feel at same cost of the tented cottages with activities available include cycling around the countryside to even day trips to the Aberdares Ranges (but you need to arrange this before with the Management)</p>

            <p> And if you want to enjoy a true home feeling, they have got a self-catering Accommodation for you. Just a kilometer or so away from the cottages on the banks of River Mathioya is where your home will be at their self-catering cottages</p>

            <p>On arrival at Bhoramdeo Jungle Retreat, our guesthouse in the Maikal Hills, we’re greeted with flower garlands and have a red tilaka (a sign of welcome) dotted on our foreheads. A three-hour drive from Raipur airport, the retreat is intimate and simple, with big, overgrown gardens peppered with summerhouses and hammocks, and tribal motifs painted on the walls.</p>
